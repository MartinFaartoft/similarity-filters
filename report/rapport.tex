\section{Introduction}

We will analyse and compare two different approaches to solving the problem of querying a set for an approximate match on a query element.

TODO 2 paragraffer om LSH i bit-vector context


Kirsch and Mitzenmacher propose in the paper 'Distance-Sensitive Bloom Filters'\cite{paper:harvard} a novel way of using Bloom filters. The aim is to expand upon classical Bloom filters, enabling them to answer the question: "Does a set contain an element similar to a given element?". They note that such a data structure has a number of practical uses, if it can be made sufficiently effective in both time and space.

The way they accomplish this is by using locality sensitive hashing algorithms (TODO REF), such that two elements that are sufficiently similar will, with a high probability, hash to the same value. They also use a partitioned Bloom filter, which is a like a standard Bloom filter except each locality sensitive hashing algorithm maps into its own bit array, instead of all the hashing algorithms share the same bit array.

When querying the Bloom filter for an approximate match, the element is hashed with all the hashing algorithms, and the corresponding indiceses are checked. If there are more bits, than a specified threshold (T), that is set to 1, it returns that the data contains an element that is close to the query element. The use of a threshold is the reason why it is possible to have false positives using this data structure.

A disadvantage to this approach, compared to a classical Bloom filter, is that it introduces the possibility of false negatives.

\subsection{Kinesere}
The paper written by [TODO] takes a different approach than [TODO ref mitz]. They use a standard Bloom Filter data structure, but with LSH in place of ordinary hash functions - they call this a 'Locality Sensitive Bloom Filter'. This 'naive' approach, has a high probability of both False Positives and False Negatives, so they augment this with additional data structures.

Minimizing False Positives:
Every time an element $q$ is checked for approximate membership, the LSBF is checked. If every bit in the array that $q$ hashes to is set to $1$, that could mean one of two things.
1) An element $p$ is in the LSBF, that is approximately close to $q$ (a true positive)
2) Multiple elements in the LSBF, together, have set the bits to $1$, and no single element is approximately close to $q$. (a false positive).

To minimize the probability of a FP, a Verification Scheme Bloom Filter is maintained as follows: Every time an element is added to the LSBF, the bit positions that are set to $1$ by that element, are encoded and added to a separate, standard Bloom Filter (the Verification Scheme). Now when the LSBF would answer 'yes' to an AMQ [TODO define], the Verification Scheme is queried to check if all the $1$ bits in the LSBF was due to any single element. If the Verification Scheme answer 'no', then a FP is detected in the LSBF, and 'no' is answered to the AMQ. However, the Verification Scheme is also prone to FP, since this a property of Bloom Filters, so this approach only servers to reduce the probability of FP, not eliminate them.

Minimizing False Negatives:
They use a method called Active Overflowed Scheme, which utilizes the property of the locality sensitive hashing algorithms that proximate elements will be stored close to each other. The idea is that a pair of close elements may not be hashed to the same value, but instead be put in adjacent bins in the bit array. So when querying, instead of just looking at the bits which represents the hashed element, you also check the $t$ closest bits to either side. $t$ will depend on the price of false positives compared to false negatives as this approach will introduce more false positives.
